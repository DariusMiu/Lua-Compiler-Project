## Just a simple compiler for my Computer Programming Languages course  
Scans, parses, then interprets and runs a lua file  
This project only works with an extremely simplified version of lua  

##### Project Components:  
`1.` Scanner  
`2.` Parser  
`3.` Interpreter  

##### Progress:  
`1.` Done  
`2.` In Progress  
`3.` Pending  

## Notes:  
##### Scanner:  
When run, the scanner will automatically scan test.lua. To scan a different file, simply call it from command line like so:  
`./scanner mow.lua`
